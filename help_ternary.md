**Ternary plot**

Each triangular panel is an instance of a *ternary plot*. A ternary plot is a triangle-shaped two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional data that sum to a constant. It is sufficient to understand that a point distant from a corner, for example, far from the top corner labeled 0, represents an individual with a low probability of being in group 0. The mid-point represents an individual with equal probabilities (0.33) for all three groups.

The points in the plot above represent the following values. See the eAppendix for the explanation of how to look up point (h).
